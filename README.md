# Spinel

Spinel is an operating system. It was written to allow me to explore the
world of systems programming after trying and failing to wait patiently
for it to be taught to me in university.

This is the old version of Spinel. Spinel's development was reset in
February 2020. You can see the current progress of the restart on the 
[master](https://github.com/Sparkpin/spinel) branch.
