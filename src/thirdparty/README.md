third party source files does not affect the license of the rest of Spinel
(this precludes the use of GPL'd source files).

Code in this directory is not required to match the coding style in the rest of
Spinel. However, modifications may be made to third party code to the extent that
the license provided will allow.

Any code that has been released to the public domain will be relicensed under
