Spinel
======

Welcome to Spinel!

Spinel is an operating system written to explore the world of systems
programming. It came to be after the project creator, Ruby, got too curious
about operating systems and took a deep dive into the crazy world of low-level
systems programming.

Right now, Spinel is in a very prototypical state. It currently only supports
x86. Future plans include x86_64 support, user mode, multitasking, and someday,
a GUI. Other architectures might be supported as well (Motorola 68k, PowerPC,
ARM, and RISC-V  are all likely candidates).

Spinel was originally started in December 2019. That version of Spinel is still
available on the
"`original <https://github.com/Sparkpin/spinel/tree/original>`_"
branch of the Spinel repository. In February 2020, Ruby decided to restart
development on Spinel to clean up the code base. The reset reached feature
parity at the end of that same month (2020-02-27) and was merged that day.

You can see the current plans for Spinel on the
`projects page <https://github.com/Sparkpin/spinel/projects/1>`_.

.. warning:: Spinel is in a very early state. It is not production ready, and
   it may contain serious bugs or security flaws. Please keep this in mind if
   you plan on using Spinel.

   The API for Spinel is currently unstable. Please keep this in mind.
