# Spinel Code of Conduct

The goal of Spinel is to be an open source operating system. To this end, this
code of conduct shall be employed to ensure a welcoming environment for all who
wish to contribute to the project. While similar hobbyist operating system
projects function very well without a code of conduct (or in some cases, a
rather bare-bones code of conduct), larger projects have seen quite a bit of
strife over inclusiveness and being awesome to each other, as strange as it
sounds. This code, therefore, is to prevent Spinel from becoming a flamewar
battleground rather than an operating system.

This code is intended to be rather short, and should be mostly obvious.

## Rules

Summary: Please be nice to people! Using English is recommended!

* Fighting fire with fire only leads to more fire and is thus prohibited.
* Do not discriminate by gender, sexual orientation, mental affliction,
disability, race, age, appearance, etc. This includes the usage of slurs.
* Don't refer to people by names they no longer wish to go by.
* Please use the correct gender when referring to people. If you are unsure
of someone's gender, utilize gender netural terms. Since the 1300s, the gender
neutral pronoun for people in English is "they".
* NSFW content or behaviour (sexual behaviour, pornography, gore) is
prohibited.
* This is worth reduplicating: sexual behaviour is prohibited.
* Abuse (stalking, threats of violence, harassment) is prohibited.
* Libel and slander are prohibited (and may be illegal in your jurisdiction).
* Abusing people in real life (physically, sexually, mentally, emotionally,
etc.) or supporting those who do is grounds for penalization.
* Communication in English is preferred when contributing to Spinel. Most
contributors, including the project maintainer, understand English and may
have limitied abilities in other languages. If your communication is not in
English, it may be ignored until someone knowledgeable in your language notices
it.

## Penalties

Penalties for violating the rules may be decided on a case-by-case basis, but
the typical penalty (with the exception of the rule about speaking English) is
being effectively banned from the repository: your account will be blocked, and
all pull requests from you will be denied immediately.

## What if I don't agree?

The intention of these rules is to create an environment that encourages
efficient, successful collaboration among many people. These rules are fairly
baseline, at least from the perspective of the project maintainer. That being
said, if you do not agree to these terms, not all hope for your programming
curiosity is lost. There are several operating systems out there with less
restrictive or even no codes of conduct. Note that even these operating
systems may prohibit your contributions if your behaviour is egregious enough
(ex. murder, sexual assault).
